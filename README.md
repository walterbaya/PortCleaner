## Kill Port Script (Windows 10)

This script has been tested on Windows 10.

### Usage

1. **Run the script**  
   Double-click `runKillPort` (e.g. `runKillPort.bat`).

2. **Grant permissions**  
   When prompted, grant **Administrator** privileges.  
   > This is required for the script to use the functions needed to terminate the process occupying the port.

3. **Enter the port number**  
   When asked, type the **port number** you want to free up (numeric only) and press **Enter**.

4. **View results**  
   The script will display the **PID** of the process and confirm that the port is now available.
