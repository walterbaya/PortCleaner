# PortCleaner
PortCleaner is a lightweight Windows 10 utility script that lets you quickly free up any TCP/UDP port by automatically identifying and terminating the process thatâ€™s blocking it. Simply run the script with administrator privileges, enter the port number you want to clear, and PortCleaner will show you the PID and confirm the port is now available.
